workflow:
    - parser config file: acquire information from config file or if there isn't take the default and initialize struct and class
    - "socket" server client run? file: organize all concern about server and client think to keep alive
    - "HTTP" request? response? file: working for

parser:
    read config file check if is ok and populate struct
config:
    error check? initialize?
server:
    initialize all about server :
        create socket
        bind socket
        listen on the socket
        accept connection
        send and receive data? maybe is HTTP block
        disconnect?
client:
    initialize all about client :
        create socket
        connect to the server
        send and receive data
        disconnect??
